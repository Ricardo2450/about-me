  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p1>
    Hello! My name is Ricardo Soto-Fabela and I created this page so you can get to know me a little bit. I'm a Navy veteran and former firefighter. I did ten years in the navy being stationed in Washington DC, San Diego, and Pensacola. While in the Navy, I was an aircraft firefighter for 8 years and structural firefighter for 3 years. I currently moved back to Arizona, the state I grew up in. Huge Phoenix suns fan and Dallas Cowboys fan too. When im not watching sports, Im usually playing video games with my girlfriend. I decided to learn how to code because I thought it be a great job field to get into. So I joined Code Fellows and is currently enrolled into there software developer program. My goal is to one day work for one of the FAANG companies or a company I really love. Also, to have financial freedom and travel the world.
