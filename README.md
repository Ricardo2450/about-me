## About me

I build a Web page highlighting a little bit about me for people to read. I also prompted a user to answer seven yes or no questions about me. At the end, they could see how well they did.

### Reflections and Comments

* I had a tough time getting CSS to work. Its definitely my week point. However I did overcome a few challenges and overall. I like how my page looks right now. Its basic but took me awhile to get it like that. I want to be able to do more advance stuff in the future once I have a better understanding of CSS.
